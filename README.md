# Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Multi-Class Brain Segmentation in T1 MRI

**Problem Statement**: Fully supervised, multi-class 3D brain segmentation in T1 MRI. 

**Note**: The following approach won **1st place place in the 2019 Medical Image Segmentation and Applications: Brain Tissue Segmentation Challenge** at [Universitat de Girona](https://www.udg.edu) scoring **Dice Coefficient: 0.932 [CSF: 0.906, GM: 0.947, WM: 0.945] and Hausdorff Distance (mm): 10.306 [CSF: 15.909, GM: 7.620, WM: 7.387] at test-time**, during the 2018-20 Joint Master of Science in [Medical Imaging and Applications (MaIA)](https://maiamaster.udg.edu) program.

## Patch Extraction/Multi-Scale Input

offering a different receptive field and degree of contextual information to its subsequent CNN.* 

    
## Loss Function 

![Loss Function](reports/images/loss.png)*Figure 2.  Training (a-d) and validation (e-h) moving-average curves monitoring the Dice
Coefficient of predictions for a residual 3D U-Net model with different loss functions, but otherwise identical hyperparameters (patch size 64 cube, mini-batch size 8, cyclic learning rate between 5e-05−2.5e-04). While soft dice loss alone demonstrates the weakest performance, when combined with softmax cross-entropy, it matches and outperforms the latter alone (particularly for CSF).*
